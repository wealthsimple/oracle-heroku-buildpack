# Heroku Buildpack for Oracle

Heroku buildpack for setting up Oracle Instant Client and the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

# Usage

## Add a detect hook (required)

In order for this buildpack to execute, it will look for a `.oracle.yml` file in your app's root.  The file can be empty but it must exist.

    touch .oracle.yml

## Add Buildpack

You'll need to use multiple buildpacks. This buildpack will need to be invoked first, followed by your language buildpack.  Heroku now supports configuring multiple buildpacks natively, or you can use the [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi) buildpack.

### Setup using heroku-buildpack-multi

The benefit to using [heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi) is that you can version-control your environment changes.

    heroku buildpacks:clear
    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi

Then inside `.buildpacks`, add the following contents:

    https://github.com/luizalabs/heroku-buildpack-oracle
    https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby

### Setup using heroku's native support for multiple buildpacks

Heroku natively also support's multiple buildpacks, the same setup as above can be achieved as follows:

    heroku buildpacks:clear
    heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
    heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi


# Configuration (Optional)

It is sometimes desirable to use `tnsnames.ora` or `sqlnet.ora` to configure how Oracle connects to a database or to use `sqlnet.ora` to configure connection wallets.

The `tnsnames.ora` and `sqlnet.ora` files are often located in `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin`.  This buildpack will correctly setup `$ORACLE_HOME` and `$TNS_ADMIN` to point to `$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin`.  A location for `tnsnames.ora` or `sqlnet.ora` can be configured inside the `.oracle.yml` file:

    cat .oracle.yml
    ---
    tnsnames.ora: config/tnsnames.ora
    sqlnet.ora: config/sqlnet.ora

The files will be symlinked into `vendor/oracle-instantclient/network/admin`

You do not need both `tnsnames.ora` and `sqlnet.ora`, they are both optional, the buildpack will work fine without them.
